His success in South Africa gave him an international reputation, and in 1915 he returned to India and within a few years became the leader of a nationwide struggle for Indian home rule. Gandhi grew up in a home steeped in religion, and he took for granted religious tolerance and the doctrine of ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings). India achieved dominion status in 1947, but the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan was a great disappointment to Gandhi, who had long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity.'},\n",

      "Model weights for the first version of Llama were made available to the research community under a non-commercial license, and access was granted on a case-by-case basis. Unauthorized copies of the model were shared via BitTorrent. In response, Meta AI issued DMCA takedown requests against repositories sharing the link on GitHub. Subsequent versions of Llama were made accessible outside academia and released under licenses that permitted some commercial use. Llama models are trained at different parameter sizes, ranging between 1B and 405B. Originally, Llama was only available as a foundation model. Starting with Llama 2, Meta AI started releasing instruction fine-tuned versions alongside foundation models.\n",

As language models, LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a self-supervised and semi-supervised training process.\n",
      "The largest and most capable LLMs are artificial neural networks built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, enabling efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data. Modern models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks or guided by prompt engineering. These models acquire predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in.\n",

These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience (e.g. the neuroscience of free will) and philosophy of mind, though some evolutionary biologists and theoretical physicists have also made several allusions to the subject.[50][51]\\nReductionistic and eliminative materialistic approaches, for example the Multiple Drafts Model, hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the brain and its neurons, thus adhering to biological naturalism.[51][52][53]\\nOn the other hand, some scientists, like Andrei Linde, have considered that consciousness, like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one\\'s perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.[54] Hypotheses of consciousness and spacetime explain consciousness in describing a \"space of conscious elements\",[54] often encompassing a number of extra dimensions.[55] Electromagnetic theories of consciousness solve the binding problem of consciousness in saying that the electromagnetic field generated by the brain is the actual carrier of conscious experience; there is however disagreement about the implementations of such a theory relating to other workings of the mind.[56][57] Quantum mind theories use quantum theory in explaining certain properties of the mind. Ludwig Wittgenstein and the logical positivists said:[citation needed] \"Expressed in language, the question is meaningless\"; because, in life the statement the \"meaning of x\", usually denotes the consequences of x, or the significance of x, or what is notable about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals \"x\", in the statement the \"meaning of x\", the statement becomes recursive, and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.\\n Some popular answers include:\\nTo realize one\\'s potential and ideals\\nTo evolve, or to achieve biological perfection\\nTo seek wisdom and knowledge\\nTo do good, to do the right thing\\nMeanings relating to religion\\nTo love, to feel, to enjoy the act of living\\nTo have power, to be better\\nLife has no meaning\\nOne should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life\\nIn popular culture\\n Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.[72][73]\\nEpicurus, a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear (ataraxia) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain (aponia) is absent through one\\'s knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one\\'s desires.'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",

    "###ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting):\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "###How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: The agent receives a question or task.\n",
    "Step 2: It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "Step 3: Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g., searching a database, calculating something).\n",
    "Step 4: The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "Step 5: It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combines thinking and doing (reasoning and actions).\n",
    "Performs iterative steps, updating its process based on action results.\n",
    "Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original task: ‚ÄúCalculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.‚Äù\n",
    "Reasoning: \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "Action: Perform the multiplication.\n",
    "Result: \"There are 28 apples.\"\n",
    "Reasoning: \"I am done.\""

    "\n",
    "This approach allows the AI to ask itself follow-up questions when it doesn't immediately know the answer. It performs a recursive questioning process to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable ones.\n",
    "Once the AI generates these follow-up questions, it performs an external search (e.g., through Google or an internal database) to gather the necessary information before formulating a response.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Receive a complex question.\n",
    "Step 2: The agent identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions.\n",
    "Step 3: It performs a search or fetches answers to these questions from external resources (like a web search).\n",
    "Step 4: The answers are aggregated to provide a complete response.\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Emphasizes question decomposition.\n",
    "Relies on external search for sub-questions.\n",
    "Useful for answering open-ended or broad questions where the answer is not immediately available.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Original question: ‚ÄúHow many moons does Jupiter have?‚Äù\n",
    "Sub-question: ‚ÄúWhat is Jupiter?‚Äù (search)\n",
    "Sub-question: ‚ÄúWhat are moons?‚Äù (search)\n",
    "Finally, it retrieves the answer: \"Jupiter has 79 moons.\""
